## Problem Description

The repository addresses two main problem types:

### Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)

CVRP is a combinatorial optimization problem in which a fleet of vehicles is tasked with delivering goods to a set of customers while minimizing the total distance traveled and ensuring that each vehicle's capacity constraint is not exceeded.

### Mathematical Function Optimization

The repository includes a Genetic Algorithm for minimizing various mathematical functions, including:
- Sphere Function
- Rastrigin Function
- Ackley Function

## Usage

To utilize the ACO algorithm for CVRP or the Genetic Algorithm for mathematical function optimization, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the provided Python scripts with the desired settings.

For specific instructions, refer to the user guide and scripts in the repository.

## Features

- ACO algorithm implementation for solving CVRP.
- Genetic Algorithm for optimizing mathematical functions.
- Customizable problem instances and parameter settings.

## Algorithms

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

The ACO algorithm follows the steps of an ant colony system, including initialization, ant movement, pheromone update, and termination. It is used for solving CVRP instances.

### Genetic Algorithm (GA)

The GA aims to minimize mathematical functions, with specific implementations for the sphere, Rastrigin, and Ackley functions.
